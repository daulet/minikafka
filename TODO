clean up producer.go or setup better benchmark:
https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/go/current/overview.html#go-example-code

Add latency test to verify write/read decoupling in publisher: write shouldn't take ~= latency

Multiple broker support with all ack

use toxyproxy slicer to test message parsing: https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy#slicer

Publisher and Subscriber should implement Writer and Reader interface respectively

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test

setup benchmark, start with kafka, use toxiproxy to simulate latency across brokers

migrate tests to docker

pick features to support from here: https://medium.com/swlh/why-kafka-is-so-fast-bde0d987cd03

test that broker.log is appended, not replaced
publisher test fails if we don't listen for ack in test

read system design articles on kafka/queues for:
figure out deployment - image for brokers, how they boot, recover; how subs and pubs discover kafka
